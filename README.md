# üì± Click and Test - Remote Health Monitoring

**Click and Test** is an innovative remote health monitoring project designed to track real-time heart rate and body temperature data. Using an ESP8266 module to gather health metrics and a Flutter app to retrieve and display this data from the Blynk IoT cloud, this project aims to make remote health monitoring accessible and efficient.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **ESP8266 Module**: A WiFi-enabled microcontroller that senses heart rate and body temperature.
- **Blynk IoT Cloud**: A cloud platform that securely stores the health data and provides API access for real-time updates.
- **Flutter**: Cross-platform mobile framework used to create the app interface that displays health metrics.

## üîç Project Overview
This project includes two main components:
1. **ESP8266 Module Setup**: Configured to measure heart rate and body temperature data through sensors connected to the body. This data is then sent to the Blynk IoT cloud for storage.
2. **Flutter App**: The app connects to the Blynk cloud, retrieves the data, and displays it in real time, allowing for remote health monitoring.

With this setup, users can access their vital stats anytime and anywhere, making it a valuable tool for remote healthcare and wellness monitoring.

## üì• App Download
You can downlaod and have a view of the app from here : [Click And Test](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1BWzWIIFsa-5IS7OKSBW800su0mT4hL6j). Although the app usage will need the model to be connected as well, which is only possible if you will recreate the model so, this will only provide you the access to app, integrating the model will give you the fully-functioning app.
